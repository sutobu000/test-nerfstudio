        "*  **Downloading custom data is stalling (no output):**\n",
        "    * This is a bug in Colab. The data is processing, but may take a while to complete. You will know processing completed if `data/nerfstudio/custom_data/transforms.json` exists. Terminating the cell early will result in not being able to train.\n",
        "*  **Processing custom data is taking a long time:**\n",
        "    * The time it takes to process data depends on the number of images and its resolution. If processing is taking too long, try lowering the resolution of your custom data.\n",
        "*  **Error: Data processing did not complete:**\n",
        "    * This means that the data processing script did not fully complete. This could be because there were not enough images, or that the images were of low quality. We recommend images with little to no motion blur and lots of visual overlap of the scene to increase the chances of successful processing.\n",
        "*   **Training is not showing progress**:\n",
        "    * The lack of output is a bug in Colab. You can see the training progress from the viewer.\n",
        "* **Viewer Quality is bad / Low resolution**:\n",
        "    * This may be because more GPU is being used on training that rendering the viewer. Try pausing training or decreasing training utilization.\n",
        "* **WARNING: Running pip as the 'root' user...:**:\n",
        "    * This and other pip warnings or errors can be safely ignored.\n",
        "* **Other problems?**\n",
        "    * Feel free to create an issue on our [GitHub repo](https://github.com/nerfstudio-project/nerfstudio).\n"
